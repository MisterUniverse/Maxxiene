**Components**
1. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): It is a symmetric encryption algorithm that was established by the
U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. In symmetric-key encryption, the same key is
used for both encryption and decryption.

2. GCM (Galois/Counter Mode): This is a mode of operation for symmetric-key cryptographic block ciphers.
It provides both encryption and built-in integrity checking. So, AES-GCM is AES encryption in Galois/Counter Mode.

3. Nonce: A nonce ("number used once") is an arbitrary number that should only be used once. It's often used for
initialization in encryption algorithms.
